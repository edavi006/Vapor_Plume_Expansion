The primary script held in this directory is "VaporPlumeExpansion.ipynb"

This script is a jupyter notebook that performs the calculations seen in the manuscript 
"Impact Ejecta Plumes in a Vacuum" Davies et al. 2020.

The script runs on order minutes and produces most of the plots in the directory. Other plots
and scripts are supporting, see separate documentation in 
"Stewart, S. T., Davies, E. J., Duncan, M. S., Lock, S. J., Root, S., Townsend, J. P., ... & Jacobsen, S. B. (2019).
