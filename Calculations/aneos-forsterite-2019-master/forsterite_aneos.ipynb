    "GitHub: https://github.com/ststewart/aneos-forsterite-2019/<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a solid-liquid-vapor ANEOS model with ionization for pure forsterite (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$). This model EOS uses the new heat capacity adjustment factor described in Stewart et al.

    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook was used to develop and document new ANEOS input parameters for the forsterite EOS that are  optimized for the liquid and vapor regions. This development project focused on improving the forsterite model EOS for impact simulations where the silicate is melted and partially vaporized upon shock and decompression.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also reproduces the figures in Stewart et al. (SCCM19). The figures include a comparison to the Tillotson EOS, so this notebook also includes Tillotson EOS functions based on the implementations in iSALE-Dellen (https://isale-code.github.io/) and Hosono et al. (2019).<p>\n",

    "<b>USAGE</b><br>\n",
    "This notebook interacts with multiple outputs from ANEOS, including phase boundary information, the calculated Hugoniot, and tabulated EOS. The notebook also reads in material properties data and extracted data from previous versions of ANEOS model parameter sets for forsterite.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be used in two modes:<br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Development mode: ANEOS is called in the local directory to generate new model output. The user can varying the model input parameters and tabular gridding schemes. This notebook produces plots of the equation of state surface and comparisons to experimental data and ab initio calculations.\n",
    "<li> Release mode: the notebook interacts with previously created ANEOS model output. This notebook provides detailed documentation of a version-controlled release of the model EOS and enables users to interact with the EOS surface and compare the model to data. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is distributed in release mode. Users who wish to use the development mode may request the modified version of ANEOS from the author.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Development mode:<br>\n",
    "The notebook calls a local aneos executable which expects a formatted ANEOS.INPUT ascii file and an ascii gridtable.txt definition file that is generated by this notebook. ANEOS produces an ANEOS.OUTPUT ascii file and gridded ascii SESAME-format EOS tables.<br>\n",
    "The user edits (1) the input parameters in ANEOS.INPUT (separately from this notebook) and (2) the output EOS table parameters in the notebook cell below.<br>\n",
    "This notebook reads some parameters from ANEOS.INPUT and assumes that the variables are spaced by 10 columns.<br> \n",
    "When the notebook is run, the code issues a system call to run the aneos program in the local directory and reads in results from the ANEOS.OUTPUT, NEW-SESAME-STD.TXT, and NEW-SESAME-EXT.TXT files to make the plots below and to generate the GADGET format EOS table and other miscellaneous files.<p>\n",

    "<b>APPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS</b><br>\n",
    "The reference state is the solid at STP. As a compromise to span the whole phase diagram, the reference bulk modulus is lower than the true value at STP. The Debye temperature is fitted to attain the true specific entropy at melting with a single solid phase. The heat capacity adjustment parameter is set to 1.35 to fit the temperatures and entropies on the shock Hugoniot and liquid heat capacity at 1 bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "This EOS table is appropriate for problems where forsterite/olivine is present as a warm solid near the melt curve, liquid, and partially vaporized. The temperatures in the liquid field are much improved with the adjusted heat capacity. The critical point is much improved over previous version of forsterite ANEOS used in modeling impact processes. The bulk modulus is a compromise to produce a model that spans a wide range of P-V-T and accommodates the limitations of the formulas used for the Gruneisen parameter in ANEOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model does not include a high-pressure phase transition to avoid the artificial discontinuities introduced in the liquid field by ANEOS. This model becomes increasingly erroneous for shock pressures above about 1000 GPa as the curvature on the Hugoniot and the Grueneisen parameter are not correct at extremely high densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is not appropriate for problems entirely in solid forsterite. The modulus of the solid is low and high-pressure polymorphs are neglected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional form for the Gruneisen parameter in ANEOS has difficulty matching the experimental values for liquid forsterite.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpolation procedure to make the GADGET2 density-entropy-grid table uses linear interpolation on the same density grid as the density-temperature SESAME table to obtain the EOS values at each GADGET2 entropy grid point. This method introduces substantial errors in the vapor dome. <p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>MODEL DEVELOPMENT QUALITY (MDQ) RATING</b><br>\n",
    "We provide an MDQ rating which is saved as a 301-style SESAME table. The MDQ rating is a qualitative guide for users that provides some known quality control information. This information is necessarily subjective and incomplete. The rating does not guarantee any fidelity in the EOS model except for points that have been directly compared to experimental data in the plots below. See discussion with the plots below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>INTERPOLATION ISSUES AND THE INTERPOLATION ERROR PARAMETER (IEP)</b><br>\n",
    "The IEP measures the quality of the interpolation scheme for a specific variable on a specific density-temperature grid. Robust interpolation of wide-ranging EOS tables is known to be a difficult problem. Most interpolation schemes individually interpolate each variable, which leads to interpolated states that are not thermodynamically self-consistent. While some thermodynamically consistent interpolation schemes have been developed (e.g., Zeman et al. 2019), they more computationally intensive than simpler interpolation methods and have not been widely implemented yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IEP is calculated on the density-temperature grid using the following method: \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Start with a grid that is twice as dense as the desired final grid and generate an ANEOS density-temperature table.\n",
    "    <li>Split the table into two tables made from the even rows and columns and the odd rows and columns.\n",
    "    <li>Interpolate for the odd index grid values using the even index table.\n",
    "    <li>The IEP is given by (interpolated value-original value)/(original value) of the odd index table.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "A tabulated EOS must be sufficiently densely gridded to capture the phase boundaries. Otherwise, non-physical material response can arise during problems that cross the phase boundary. Simple interpolations schemes generally produce large errors in and near phase boundaries. See illustrative plots below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>We recommend that the interpolation scheme, the implementation of the scheme into EOS code functions (e.g., the source code), and IEP values should be reported in published works that use tabular EOS.</b> See the Jupyter Notebook in the subdirectory and the plots below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>ANEOS NOTES</b><br>\n",
    "The ANEOS source code was provided by Jay Melosh and Gareth Collins. This version included Melosh's (2007) treatment for molecular gas and the capability to include a melt curve and solid-solid/liquid-liquid transition (Collins & Melosh LPSC 2014).<br>\n",
    "In this work, Melosh and Collins version of ANEOS was modified to adjust the Debye model for the thermal term in the Helmholtz free energy to approach a user-defined heat capacity at high temperatures. The multiplicative factor $f_{cv}$ is entered in input value V44, and the high-temperature heat capacity is $3f_{cv}Nk$.<p>\n",
    "The ANEOSTEST.f routine was modified to output tabulated EOS. Note that the current version of this function sets positive pressures smaller than 1.E-30 GPa equal to 1.E-30 GPa.<br>\n",
    "ANEOS2.f was modified to increase the number of points tabulated on the melt curve in the ANEOS.OUTPUT file and to gather the variables for the heat capacity modification.<br>\n",
    "ANHUG.f was modified to output more Hugoniot points.<br>\n",
    "ANEOS1.f and ANEOS2.f were modified to increase the high temperature limit for the heat capacity (Stewart et al., SCCM19).<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS</b><br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Add information to MDQ to identify regions with experimental validation.\n",
    "<li>Add binary format output for EOS tables.\n",
    "<li>Examine other table interpolation schemes, including thermodynamically self-consistent schemes such as Zeman et al. (2019).\n",
    "<li>Unpublished EOS data were used in the development of this model EOS. These data will be added to future versions of this model development notebook when published.\n",
    "<li>Try rational function interpolation method of Kerley (1977) on the original density-temperature-grid table.\n",
    "<li>Plots of free energy terms.\n",
    "<li>Currently, SESAME ascii file sizes are limited by github. Future releases will use binary SESAME files.\n",

    "We provide an MDQ rating which is saved as a 301-style SESAME table. The MDQ rating is a qualitative guide for users that provides some known quality control information. This information is necessarily subjective and incomplete. The rating does not guarantee any fidelity in the EOS model except for points that have been directly compared to experimental data in the plots below.<br>\n",

    "    <li>MDQ=1: Data point has experimental data and falls within experimental error. NOT USED AT THIS TIME. Will be added in the future.\n",
    "    <li>MDQ=0: Data point rating is neutral. The value appears to be a thermodynamically self-consistent model point without known gross errors.\n",
    "    <li>MDQ=-1: Data point rating is erroneous. The value is not thermodynamically correct in a known way. In this work, this flag is used for the replacement values for the tension region to generate an all positive pressure equilibrium EOS table. The current replacement scheme is to use the values in the adjacent grid cell: for each P and T in the sublimation region, use values at the adjacent density with positive pressure. The magnitude of the error is small, but the derivatives in this region will be incorrect.\n",
    "    <li>MDQ=-2: Data point rating is non-physical. The value is not thermodynamically correct in a known way. In this work, this flag is used for ANEOS output with negative values for the specific entropy.\n",

    "    <li>MDQ=-5: Developer judgement that this region of phase space does not provide a robust representation of the material. Applied to regions with pressures > 1 TPa. The Gruneisen gamma value is too large for liquid in this region and missing physics at higher pressures and temperatures. Seek alternative models for problems focused in this region.\n",

    "Tillotson is a simple pressure-volume-internal energy equation of state model that was developed for metals (Tillotson 1962). Temperature is typically approximated by a constant heat capacity. Here, I have not implemented a temperature calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no true phase boundaries but there is a split in the EOS between condensed and gas regions with an interpolated region. \n",

    "Here are the material parameters selected for olivine by Marinova et al. Icarus 2011 (used by Hosono et al. 2019):<br>\n",
    "$\\rho_0$ = Reference density at zero pressure = 3500 kg/m$^3$<br>\n",
    "$A$ = Bulk modulus $K_0$ =  131e9 Pa<br>\n",
    "$B$ = B constant = 49e9 Pa<br>\n",
    "$E_0$ = E0 contant (NOT reference state specific internal energy) = 550e6 J/kg<br>\n",
    "$a$ = a constant = 0.5 [-]<br>\n",
    "$b$ = b constant = 1.4 [-]<br>\n",

    "    \n",
    "Because the Tillotson equations produce large negative pressure values when $\\rho<\\rho_0$ and $E<E_{CV}$, the EOS is implemented with a pressure minimum that varies between implementations and papers. Here, I set the pressure in the cold region to the minimum value before interpolating. In the original codes for iSALE and Hosono et al. 2019, the interpolated region was calculated prior to resetting to a pressure minimum. To see the difference, switch between the Hosono and iSALE functions at the bottom of the next code cell.<p>\n",
